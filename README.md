# 👋 Hi, I’m @TarangsFarm  
- 👀 I’m interested in organic farming, sustainable agriculture, and building tools for eco-friendly growth 🌿  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to blend farming with technology – from IoT-based compost monitoring to building simple farm management apps 📲  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source agri-tech projects, gardening tools, or even soil science experiments!  
- 📫 How to reach me: WhatsApp/Call at +91-7000338275 or email me at rootamrit.biz@gmail.com  
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him (but the farm speaks the universal language of nature 🌎)  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can talk about vermicomposting for hours, and my best employees are earthworms 🪱💼
